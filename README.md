# Embedded OpenSCAD

This is a very WIP extension that enables you to preview and export OpenSCAD files without leaving VS Code.

## Features

- Preview OpenSCAD models directly in VS Code
- Export OpenSCAD models to STL files
- Support for OpenSCAD libraries (BOSL2, etc.) via user-defined library paths
